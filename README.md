##  "A Bookworm’s To-Do List for Stories!
A cute lil' bookshelf made with Flask, where I can add books, edit their ✨vibes✨ (ratings), and delete the ones I’m done with! Because every story deserves a space—even in a minimalist app!"

Read. Rate. Repeat.
Built with learning, not perfection.

Made with brain + bugs + bravery

Books I read = Bugs I squash.

# Virtual Bookshelf 📚✨

Hi there! I'm Srinjoyee, and this is my *Day 62 project—a tiny, to-the-point **Virtual Bookshelf* built with *Flask* and a curious brain full of bugs (but learning fast)!  
Think of it like a to-do list for your books—you can add, delete, and rate your reads!

---

## What's This All About? 🤔

I’m currently on a coding journey, and every day I try to build something that reflects what I’m learning.  
This bookshelf project was my way of understanding:

- Flask routing 🛣
- Form handling ✍
- Templating (Jinja2!) 🧁
- Basic CRUD logic 🧠

And I turned all of that into a *minimal app* where you can keep track of your books—  
because "books and bugs, both need attention!".

## Features ✨

- ➕ *Add a new book* – Any book you’re currently reading or planning to read.
- ✏ *Edit the rating* – Change your review whenever your heart changes.
- ❌ *Delete a book* – Done reading? Clean up your shelf.
- 🧼 *Zero distractions* – No CSS magic here, just function > form!

Why I Built This ❤

Learning to code is a rollercoaster of bugs and lightbulb moments.
I made this project to:

Reinforce my Flask fundamentals

See my Python code come to life

Track my learning journey in public

Share something—even if it's simple!


> I believe every "tiny" project is a big step in learning.
This is my bookshelf today. Tomorrow? Who knows—maybe a library system!
